# CS2303-Systems-Programming-Projects
Projects for my CS2303 class. Some are programmed in C, and some are programmed in C++. 

- Homework 1 is a simple assignment with starter code to learn how to use include files in C.
- Homework 2 focuses on traversing doubly linked lists using pointers.
- Homework 3 uses file I/O and a BFS to play a game of clue.
- Homework 4 does not exist.
- Homework 5 used file I/O to read information about students and calculate statistical variables.
- Homework 6 reads newspaper writer and article information and uses a sorting algorithm to assign articles to writers.
